Hi, I’m Will!

I’m a freelance developer turned technical program manager from the United States.  I grew up in the suburbs of New York City, spent an amazing few years in Yokohama Japan, and currently live in Seattle.

I majored in Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame which I attended on a US Navy scholarship.  Following graduation, I served as an officer in the US Navy for six years, leading various engineering, network operations, and cybersecurity teams.  I’m now at Microsoft where I manage programs to scale our global cloud infrastructure.
